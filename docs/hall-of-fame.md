## How this page works

This page highlights people who support ImgCompress and want to be listed publicly.

- I add supporters who opt in through [Donations](sponsorship.md).
- I update this list when new contributions come in.
- If you prefer to stay private, I will not list your name or profile.

If you donate via PayPal, include a short note with your GitHub or website link so I can credit you properly.
