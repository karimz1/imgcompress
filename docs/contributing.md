## Developer Resources

!!! info
    As of Jan 26, ImgCompress has about 20k downloads ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/karimz1/imgcompress)). To keep the project reliable, I only accept changes that pass the full test suite (unit, integration, and E2E). If a test fails due to a feature change, please add or update E2E tests so behavior stays stable and regressions are caught early. Start with the [Developer Guide](developers.md) and the [Playwright End-to-End Testing Guide](e2e.md).

If you are planning to write code, the Developer Guide covers everything you need to know about:

*   **Local Environment**: Setting up your local development environment.
*   **Testing**: Running Unit, Integration, and E2E tests.
*   **Dev Container**: Using the VS Code Dev Container for a zero-config setup.
