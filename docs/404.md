# 404: Page not found

I've recently updated the documentation to improve clarity. The page you are looking for may have been moved to a new section or renamed.

### How to find what you need:

1.  **Search:** Click the search bar at the top to find the new location.
2.  **Navigate:** Use the tabs at the top of the page to browse the main sections.
3.  **Return:** Click the button below to go back to the home page.
