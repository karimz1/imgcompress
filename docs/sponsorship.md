## Why support open source
I am a big supporter of tools that respect your privacy. By keeping **imgcompress** free and open source, I hope to help others find simple ways to handle their photos without using the cloud.

Your help allows me to focus on:

- **New Features**: Building things requested by the community.
- **Infrastructure**: Covering the costs of building and testing imgcompress.
