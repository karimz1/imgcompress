## Why support open source
I am a big supporter of tools that respect your privacy. By keeping **imgcompress** free and open source, I hope to help others find simple ways to handle their photos without using the cloud.

Your help allows me to focus on:

- **New Features**: Building things requested by the community.
- **Infrastructure**: Covering the costs of building and testing imgcompress.

## Where support goes

Sponsorships and donations directly support work like:

- Improving performance and stability for large batches.
- Keeping documentation clear and up to date.
- Maintaining the Docker image and release process.
- Fixing bugs quickly when issues are reported.
