# Support ImgCompress

ImgCompress is built and maintained with a simple goal: providing a high-quality, privacy-focused tool for everyone. While the software is free, **ongoing maintenance, security auditing, and feature development take significant time and resources.**

By becoming a sponsor, you are directly investing in the project's longevity and helping keep it independent.

### Why Sponsor?
Your contribution allows me to stay focused on what matters most:

* **Maintenance:** Keeping dependencies up to date and the codebase secure.

* **Innovation:** Fast-tracking the roadmap and implementing community-requested features.

* **Infrastructure:** Covering the costs of CI/CD, testing environments, and documentation.
