### How to report a bug

The fastest way to fix an issue is a clear, reproducible report.

- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- Screenshots of the errors (if possible)
- Your OS, CPU type, and RAM
- Your Docker version and image tag
- Exact steps to reproduce

You can paste this checklist into a new issue and fill it out:
