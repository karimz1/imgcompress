**A self-hosted Docker image compression and conversion tool** with local AI background removal. Process unlimited images offline: no cloud uploads, no subscriptions, no per-image limits.

## ❓ Why imgcompress?

I created **imgcompress** because I was tired of the trade-offs required by modern image tools. Most web-based converters force you to choose between convenience and privacy, often requiring you to upload sensitive data to third-party servers.

I built this to be the last image web tool you'll need: a simple-looking yet powerful, local-first converter that handles everything from batch resizing to AI-driven background removal.

### 🛡️ Privacy as a Requirement

Unlike traditional web services, imgcompress is engineered with a strict "Privacy by Default" architecture. I believe privacy isn't just a feature. It’s a technical requirement.

- **100% Local:** All processing happens strictly on your hardware.

- **Zero Data Leaks:** Your files are never uploaded, buffered, or transmitted to external servers.

- **Air-Gapped Ready:** Works perfectly without an internet connection.
