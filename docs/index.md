**ImgCompress** is a high-performance, **self-hosted Docker image compression and conversion tool** featuring fully local AI-powered background removal. Process unlimited images offline with **zero cloud uploads**, no subscriptions, and complete data sovereignty.

## ❓ Why choose ImgCompress?

I created **ImgCompress** as a private alternative to cloud-based converters. Most web tools force a choice between convenience and privacy. ImgCompress is a **complete local-first image web tool** that handles everything from batch resizing to professional AI background removal on your own hardware.

### 🛡️ Privacy by Design (Compliance-Friendly)

Unlike traditional SaaS services, ImgCompress is built around a strict **“Privacy by Default”** philosophy. All image processing happens entirely on your own hardware, making it suitable for handling sensitive or regulated data without relying on external services.

- **100% Local Processing:** All operations run exclusively on your CPU/GPU.
- **No External API Calls:** Images are never uploaded, proxied, or shared with third-party servers.
- **Air-Gapped Ready:** Fully functional in offline and restricted network environments.
