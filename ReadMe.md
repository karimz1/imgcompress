## ‚ùìWhy imgcompress?

Ever been frustrated by juggling multiple programs just to convert or compress images? **I did too.**  
I'm **Karim Zouine** and I built **imgcompress** as a one-stop solution to effortlessly compress, convert, and resize your images‚Äîall inside a Docker container. No more complicated installations or worrying about privacy with online converters. Everything runs locally, secure and consistent across any system.

## üöÄ Get Started in Seconds

### Step 1: Install via Docker

Pull the latest image:

```bash
docker pull karimz1/imgcompress:latest
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Workflow

#### A. Try the NEW Web User Interface (Highly Recommended!)

1. **Launch the Web UI:**

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -p 8081:5000 karimz1/imgcompress:latest web
   ```

   *Note: The container's internal port `5000` is mapped to the host's port `8081` in my example. You can choose a different host port by modifying the `-p` flag (e.g., `-p 9090:5000`).*

2. **Access the Web UI:**

   Open your browser and go to:
   **http://localhost:8081**

3. **Explore the Features:**

   - **Drag & Drop Uploads:** Simply drag your images into the browser.
   - **Batch Processing:** Compress multiple images simultaneously.
   - **Real-Time Progress:** Watch your images optimize live.
   - **Download Instantly:** Retrieve your optimized images directly from the browser.
   - **Customizable Settings:** Tweak quality and resize options effortlessly.

------

#### B. Use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) for Advanced Workflows

**Single File Processing:**

``` bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/container/images" \
  -v "$(pwd)/converted:/container/converted" \
  karimz1/imgcompress:latest \
  /container/images/example.jpg /container/converted --quality 80 --width 1920
```

**Folder Processing:**

``` bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/container/images" \
  -v "$(pwd)/converted:/container/converted" \
  karimz1/imgcompress:latest \
  /container/images /container/converted --quality 85 --width 800
```

------

## How It Works

1. üìÅ Local Directory Mapping:

   Map your host machine‚Äôs directories into the Docker container:

   - **Input:** Your original images.
   - **Output:** Your optimized images.

2. ‚öôÔ∏è Process Parameters:

   Customize your conversion with:

   - `--quality`: Set JPEG quality (1‚Äì100, default: 85).
   - `--width`: Resize images to a desired width (optional).
   - `--debug`: Enable detailed logging.
   - `--json-output`: Generate logs in JSON format for automation workflows.

------

## Detailed Example Logs

**Text Output:**

``` plain text

        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Use Cases
- üîß **CI/CD Integration:**
  Use the `--json-output` flag to obtain structured results for automation, it acts as a mini API.

## Need Help?

Display all available options:

``` bash
docker run --rm karimz1/imgcompress --help
```

## Supported File Formats
I use the Pillow and Pillow-HEIC libraries in Python to support the following image formats in my app. Whenever Pillow adds support for more formats, the app will reflect those changes, when I do an update release.

Below is a list of all the **tested image formats*** at the moment:

- **.heic**
- **.heif**
- **.ico**
- **.jpeg**
- **.jpg**
- **.png**

------
## üñ•Ô∏è Supported Platforms

This Docker image is built and tested via my CI/CD pipeline for the following platforms:

- ‚úÖ **linux/amd64**
  *Intel/AMD x86_64 ‚Äì Suitable for most Linux distributions and Windows via WSL2*

- ‚úÖ **linux/arm64**
  *Apple Silicon (Mac & other ARM64 devices)*

- ‚úÖ **Windows**
  *Runs via WSL2 with Linux containers enabled ‚Äì no native Windows container support required.*


### üí° Testing Note

All of the supported platforms above are **tested exclusively in my CI/CD pipeline** using emulation (e.g., QEMU) and matrix builds. This means that while the builds have been verified in a virtualized environment, **they have not been all manually tested on physical hardware** for all target architectures.

------

## üîí Privacy & Security

Your images remain private‚Äî**no uploads to third-party servers.**
Everything runs locally in Docker, ensuring your data stays secure and under your control.
